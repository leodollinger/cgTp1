# cgTp1
Proposed program for computer graphics

It contains the following algorithms:

	2D geometric transformations:
		translation,
		rotation,
		scale,
		X / Y / XY reflections
	Rasterization:
		Straight -DDA,
		Bresenham,
		Circumference –Bresenham
	Crop:
		Coded regions - Cohen-Sutherland
		Parametric equation –Liang-Barsky	
    
# How to use

	Bresenham:
	To use this function, click with the left mouse button on the two points of the line to be created
	
	Bresenham Circumference:
	To use this function, click the left mouse button on the two points of the circle
	(center of the circle and on a "border of the circle") to be created
	
	
	Dda:
	To use this function, click with the left mouse button on the two points of the line to be created
	
	Translation:
	Left-click on the location where you want the figures to be moved
	
	Scale:
	Left-click on the location where you want the figures to be scaled
	
	Rotation:
	click with the left mouse button to rotate in relation to y (horizontally)
	right-click to rotate with respect to x (vertically)
	
	Mirroring:
	left-click with the mouse to mirror in relation to y (horizontally)
	click with the middle mouse button (on the wheel) to mirror x and y (diagonally)
	right-click to mirror with respect to x (vertically)
	
	
	Cohen Sutherland:
	To use this function, click with the left mouse button on the two points referring to the cut area
	
	Liang-Barsky:
	To use this function, click with the left mouse button on the two points referring to the cut area
